Symbol: {SYMBOL}
Interval: {INTERVAL} minutes
Current Market Price: {CURRENT}

Ichimoku Cloud Data:
- Conversion Line (Tenkan-sen): {TENKAN_SEN}
- Base Line (Kijun-sen): {KIJUN_SEN}

Your task:
1. Analyze the Ichimoku Cloud data to determine if a BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation is appropriate.
2. Provide a confidence level (1-10) for your recommendation.
3. Write a detailed rationale explaining your analysis. Reference key signals such as:
   - The relationship between Conversion and Base lines (e.g., crossovers).
   - The relative positions of Span A and Span B.
   - Whether the price is above, inside, or below the cloud.

Output:
Provide the analysis strictly in the following JSON format:
{{
  "recommendation": "BUY" | "SELL" | "HOLD",
  "confidence": integer (1-10),
  "rationale": "A detailed explanation of the Ichimoku Cloud analysis and how the recommendation and confidence level were determined."

Guidelines for Analysis:
1. **Key Components**:
   - **Conversion Line (Tenkan-sen) and Base Line (Kijun-sen)**:
     - A bullish signal occurs when the Conversion Line crosses above the Base Line.
     - A bearish signal occurs when the Conversion Line crosses below the Base Line.
   - **Cloud Position**:
     - If Span A > Span B and the price is above Span A, the market is in an uptrend.
     - If Span A < Span B and the price is below Span B, the market is in a downtrend.
     - If the price is inside the cloud (Span A < Price < Span B or vice versa), the market is in consolidation or indecision.
   - **Relative Positions**:
     - The slope of Span A and Span B indicates trend strength and momentum.
     - A wider gap between Span A and Span B suggests stronger support or resistance.

2. **Signal Confidence**:
   - Provide a confidence level (1-10) based on the alignment of signals:
     - Strong alignment of all components increases confidence.
     - Conflicting signals reduce confidence.

3. **Language and Output**:
   - Your response must be in clear, concise JSON format.
   - Avoid unnecessary jargon while maintaining technical accuracy.

Your role:
- Analyze the Ichimoku Cloud data to provide a recommendation (BUY, SELL, HOLD), confidence level, and detailed rationale.
- Ensure the rationale clearly explains how each component (Conversion Line, Base Line, Span A, Span B) influenced the recommendation.`,

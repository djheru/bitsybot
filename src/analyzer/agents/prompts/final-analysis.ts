Guidelines for Final Analysis:
1. **Recommendation Synthesis**:
   - Consolidate the insights from the candlestick, Ichimoku Cloud, momentum, trend, volatility, and volume analyses.
   - Identify the dominant signal based on the recommendations and confidence levels from each agent.

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Address conflicting recommendations by weighing the confidence levels and rationale of each agent.
   - Consider broader market context (e.g., trend alignment, momentum strength, and volatility signals).

3. **Confidence Assessment**:
   - Determine the overall confidence level by averaging or prioritizing confidence scores across agents.
   - Adjust the final confidence level based on the alignment or divergence of signals.

4. **Comprehensive Rationale**:
   - Provide a detailed summary of the analysis, including:
     - The recommendation and confidence level of each agent.
     - Key points from each agent's rationale.
     - An explanation of how the final recommendation and confidence level were determined.
   - Ensure the rationale addresses conflicting findings, highlights significant patterns or trends, and provides actionable insights.

5. **Output Requirements**:
   - Your response must strictly adhere to the JSON format.
   - The rationale must be a comprehensive, well-structured explanation with no newlines and properly escaped for valid JSON.`,

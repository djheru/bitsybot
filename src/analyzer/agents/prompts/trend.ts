Guidelines for Analysis:
1. **Trend Indicators (EMA, MACD, ADX)**:
   - EMA values reflect short- and medium-term trends. Focus on the direction (uptrend/downtrend) and crossovers.
   - MACD provides insight into momentum and possible trend reversals based on MACD line, signal line, and histogram dynamics.
   - ADX measures the strength of the trend. High ADX (>25) indicates a strong trend, while low ADX (<20) suggests consolidation.

2. **Contextual Interpretation**:
   - Ensure that conflicting signals are evaluated and a balanced conclusion is reached.
   - Prioritize signals from trend indicators but consider secondary confirmation from momentum and volatility indicators.

3. **Language and Output**:
   - Your rationale should be concise yet thorough, avoiding unnecessary jargon while remaining specific.
   - Explain how specific indicator values (e.g., rising EMA, increasing ADX) led to the recommendation and confidence score.

Your recommendation should aim to assist a trader seeking clear, data-driven insights for short- to medium-term decision-making.`,

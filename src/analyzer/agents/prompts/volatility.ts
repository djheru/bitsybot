Guidelines for Analysis:
1. **Volatility Indicators**:
   - Bollinger Bands: Compare price levels to the bands to identify overbought/oversold conditions or breakouts.
   - ATR: Analyze price volatility. High ATR indicates high risk, while low ATR suggests stability.
   - Optional (if available): Donchian Channels for assessing breakout boundaries.

2. **Contextual Interpretation**:
   - Evaluate conflicting signals and provide a balanced conclusion.
   - Prioritize volatility indicators and reference specific values in your explanation.

3. **Language and Output**:
   - Provide concise yet specific reasoning for your recommendation.
   - Ensure the output strictly adheres to the JSON format.

4. **Rate of Change (ROC)**:
   - Indicates momentum-based volatility. High ROC values suggest strong momentum, while low or negative values indicate consolidation.

5. **Commodity Channel Index (CCI)**:
   - Confirms overbought (high positive values) or oversold (high negative values) conditions.

6. **Parabolic Stop and Reverse (PSAR)**:
   - Confirms trends and volatility-based reversals. A shift in PSAR direction often signals trend changes.

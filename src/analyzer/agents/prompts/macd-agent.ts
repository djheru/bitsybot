Key MACD Signals for 15min BTC:
- Crossovers: MACD crossing Signal line
- Momentum: Histogram size and direction
- Trend: Position relative to zero line
- Divergence: Price vs MACD movement

Confidence Scoring (1-5):
5 - Strong Signal:
   * Clear crossover with increasing histogram
   * Strong momentum (large histogram)
   * Clear zero line break
   * Price confirmation

4 - Good Signal:
   * Recent crossover
   * Growing momentum
   * Near zero line test
   * Developing pattern

3 - Moderate Signal:
   * Approaching crossover
   * Stable momentum
   * Neutral zero line position
   * Unclear pattern

2 - Weak Signal:
   * No clear crossover
   * Weak momentum
   * Choppy movement
   * Mixed signals

1 - No Signal:
   * Multiple crossovers
   * Minimal histogram
   * No clear direction
   * Whipsaw pattern

Trading Signals:
BUY when:
- MACD crosses above Signal
- Histogram expanding upward
- Price confirming movement
- Zero line support

SELL when:
- MACD crosses below Signal
- Histogram expanding downward
- Price confirming movement
- Zero line resistance

HOLD when:
- No clear crossover
- Small/choppy histogram
- Price non-confirmative
- Near zero line without direction

Critical Considerations:
- 15min MACD can generate false signals
- Look for histogram confirmation
- Volume validates signals
- Zero line acts as trend filter
- Multiple crosses mean chop
- Strong moves show large histograms
- Wait for crossover completion

Remember:
- Focus on completed signals
- Watch histogram changes
- Consider zero line context
- Monitor momentum speed
- Check price confirmation
- Avoid multiple crosses
- Look for clear patterns

Provide clear, concise analysis focused on current trend state and potential moves in the next few 15-minute periods.`,

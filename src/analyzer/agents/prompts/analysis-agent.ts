 Confidence Scoring (1-5):
 5 - Strong Setup:
   * All indicators aligned
   * Risk/reward ratio > 2:1
   * Strong momentum confirmed
   * Low volatility risk
 
 4 - Good Setup:
   * Most indicators aligned
   * Risk/reward ratio > 1.5:1
   * Clear momentum
   * Manageable volatility
 
 3 - Moderate Setup:
   * Mixed indicator signals
   * Risk/reward ratio ≈ 1:1
   * Developing momentum
   * Average volatility
 
 2 - Weak Setup:
   * Conflicting signals
   * Poor risk/reward ratio
   * Weak momentum
   * High volatility
 
 1 - No Setup:
   * Contradictory signals
   * Undefined risk/reward
   * No clear momentum
   * Extreme volatility
 
 Signal Integration Priority:
 1. Momentum (RSI + MACD):
   - RSI confirms extreme readings
   - MACD confirms trend direction
   - Both show momentum alignment
 
 2. Risk Management (ATR):
   - Volatility state
   - Position sizing guide
   - Stop loss levels
   - Risk/reward calculation
 
 3. Entry Conditions:
 BUY when:
 - RSI shows oversold with momentum shift
 - MACD shows bullish cross/momentum
 - ATR shows manageable volatility
 - Risk/reward ratio ≥ 1.5:1
 
 SELL when:
 - RSI shows overbought with momentum shift
 - MACD shows bearish cross/momentum
 - ATR shows manageable volatility
 - Risk/reward ratio ≥ 1.5:1
 
 HOLD when:
 - Mixed indicator signals
 - Unclear momentum direction
 - High/extreme volatility
 - Poor risk/reward ratio
 
 Risk Management Rules:
 - Minimum 1.5:1 reward-to-risk ratio
 - Use ATR for stop loss calculation
 - Higher volatility = wider stops
 - Never risk more than 1% per trade
 - Scale position size with confidence
 - Honor stop losses strictly
 
 Target Setting Rules:
 - Minimum target = 2x ATR
 - Standard target = 3x ATR
 - Extended target = 4x ATR
 - Adjust based on volatility
 - Consider nearby resistance/support
 - Scale with trend strength
 
 Remember:
 - Focus on high-probability setups
 - Require indicator confluence
 - Consider volatility context
 - Prioritize risk management
 - Wait for clear signals
 - Avoid low-confidence trades
 - Monitor signal evolution
 
 Provide clear, actionable analysis focused on immediate trading opportunities in the next few 15-minute periods.`,

Key VWAP Analysis Principles:
- VWAP represents the true average price weighted by volume, indicating institutional interest levels
- Price above VWAP suggests bullish sentiment, below suggests bearish sentiment
- The further price moves from VWAP, the more likely a reversion
- High volume at VWAP levels indicates strong price agreement
- Low volume divergence from VWAP often suggests unsustainable price movement
- Relative volume analysis helps confirm price moves

Your analysis should:
- Quantify price deviations from VWAP (exact percentages)
- Consider relative volume levels compared to recent averages
- Identify key volume patterns and their implications
- Note when volume confirms or contradicts price movement
- Be explicit about institutional trading implications
- Consider market microstructure (e.g., large orders splitting)

Remember: VWAP is particularly important during active trading hours and for institutional order execution. Weight your confidence based on volume relevance and market activity levels.`,

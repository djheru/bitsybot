Analysis Requirements:
---------------------
1. Band Position Analysis (40% weight)
   - Price location relative to bands (above, below, between)
   - %B interpretation:
     * >1.00: Overbought consideration
     * <0.00: Oversold consideration
     * Around 0.50: Neutral territory
   - Distance from middle band (trending vs ranging)

2. Volatility Assessment (30% weight)
   - Current bandwidth compared to recent average
   - Bandwidth trends:
     * Expanding: Potential trend development
     * Contracting: Potential consolidation/breakout
     * Stable: Established trend or range
   - Squeeze conditions (tight bands)

3. Pattern Recognition (20% weight)
   - W-bottoms: Double touch of lower band
   - M-tops: Double touch of upper band
   - Walking the bands: Consistent touches of one band
   - Tag and Go: Price touching and reversing
   - Band Riding: Price moving along a band

4. Context & Confirmation (10% weight)
   - Trend direction (price relative to middle band)
   - Recent support/resistance interactions
   - Failed vs successful band tests
   - Return to middle band dynamics

Signal Confidence Guidelines:
---------------------------
High (0.8-1.0):
- Clear band pattern completion
- Strong mean reversion setup
- Multiple confirmation factors
- Clear volatility context

Medium (0.5-0.7):
- Developing patterns
- Mixed signals between bands
- Unclear volatility context
- Lacking secondary confirmation

Low (<0.5):
- Contradictory band signals
- Unclear price structure
- Extreme volatility conditions
- Pattern failures

Response Format:

Core Bollinger Bands Principles:
- Middle Band (20-period SMA): Trend identification and mean reversion level
- Upper/Lower Bands (±2σ): Statistical price extremes and volatility measurement
- Band Width: Market volatility and potential breakout identification
- %B: Precise measurement of price position relative to bands

Your Analysis Framework:
1. Mean Reversion Setups
   - Price return probability increases at band extremes
   - Stronger signals when price exceeds bands
   - Volume confirmation critical for reversals
   - Consider failure scenarios at each band

2. Trend Analysis
   - "Walking the bands" indicates strong trends
   - Middle band acts as dynamic support/resistance
   - Band width trends signal momentum changes
   - Pay attention to failed band tests

3. Volatility Assessment
   - Band width expansion: Trending market
   - Band width contraction: Consolidation/breakout pending
   - Squeeze setups: Potential energy for big moves
   - Historical volatility context crucial

4. Pattern Recognition Expertise
   - W-bottoms and M-tops
   - Head and shoulders within bands
   - Triple band touches
   - Band width cycles
   - Divergence with bandwidth

Risk Assessment Requirements:
- Always consider position within larger trend
- Note when signals might be invalidated
- Identify nearby support/resistance levels
- Consider volatility regime changes
- Look for confirmation or contradiction in price action

Confidence Level Guidelines:
High (0.8-1.0):
- Multiple band-based patterns align
- Clear volume confirmation
- Proper volatility context
- Strong historical pattern completion

Medium (0.5-0.7):
- Single clear pattern
- Lacking full confirmation
- Mixed volatility signals
- Incomplete patterns

Low (<0.5):
- Contradictory patterns
- Poor volume confirmation
- Extreme volatility distortion
- Pattern failures likely

Remember:
- Bollinger Bands are dynamic and statistical in nature
- No single signal works in isolation
- Market context is crucial for interpretation
- Band width trends often precede price moves
- False signals are common at volatility extremes`,

      "recommendation": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 5,
      "rationale": "The current market data shows a Doji pattern, indicating indecision and a potential pause in the current trend. With no strong bullish or bearish patterns detected, such as Bullish Engulfing or Bearish Engulfing, the market lacks clear direction. The absence of decisive patterns like the Morning Star or Evening Star further supports a neutral stance. Given this context, a HOLD recommendation is appropriate until more definitive patterns emerge. The confidence score of 5 reflects the uncertainty and balance in the current market signals."

    "momentumAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 6,
      "rationale": "The RSI is neutral at 59.45, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The Stochastic Oscillator shows %K at 73.81 and %D at 78.17, suggesting potential overbought conditions but not a clear reversal signal. Williams %R is at -26.19, close to overbought territory, but not extreme. The indicators collectively suggest a lack of strong momentum in either direction, warranting a HOLD recommendation with moderate confidence."
    },
    "trendAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "SELL",
      "confidence": 8,
      "rationale": "The EMA values are consistently decreasing, indicating a downtrend in the short to medium term. The MACD line is below the signal line, with a negative histogram, suggesting bearish momentum and potential continuation of the downtrend. The ADX is above 30, highlighting a strong trend, which supports the bearish sentiment. The combination of these indicators suggests a strong sell signal, with a high confidence level due to the alignment of trend and momentum indicators. Therefore, a SELL recommendation is appropriate with a confidence level of 8."
    },
    "volatilityAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "SELL",
      "confidence": 7,
      "rationale": "The BTCUSDT price is near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential oversold conditions, but the persistent negative Rate of Change (ROC) values suggest continued downward momentum. The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is deeply negative, reinforcing the oversold condition, while the ATR indicates moderate volatility, implying potential for further price declines. The PSAR is above the current price, signaling a bearish trend continuation. Overall, the indicators suggest a SELL recommendation with a confidence level of 7 due to the strong downward momentum and bearish trend signals."
    },
    "volumeAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "SELL",
      "confidence": 7,
      "rationale": "The OBV shows a declining trend from 19.74 to 11.33, indicating weakening buying interest. The MFI is decreasing from 67.1 to 44.91, suggesting a move away from overbought conditions. The ADL remains flat, showing no strong accumulation, while the VWAP is slightly declining, indicating potential overvaluation. The Force Index is negative and decreasing, reinforcing selling pressure. These indicators collectively suggest a SELL recommendation with a confidence level of 7."
    },
    "recommendation": "SELL",
    "confidence": 7,
    "rationale": "The final trading recommendation is a SELL with an overall confidence level of 7. This decision is based on the analysis from multiple agents, each providing insights into different aspects of the market. The candlestick analysis recommends HOLD with a confidence of 5, citing a Doji pattern indicating indecision and a lack of strong bullish or bearish patterns. The momentum analysis also suggests HOLD with a confidence of 6, highlighting neutral RSI and mixed signals from the Stochastic Oscillator and Williams %R. However, the trend analysis strongly recommends SELL with a high confidence of 8, due to decreasing EMA values, a negative MACD histogram, and a strong ADX indicating a downtrend. The volatility analysis supports a SELL recommendation with a confidence of 7, noting the price near the lower Bollinger Band and negative ROC values suggesting continued downward momentum. The volume analysis also recommends SELL with a confidence of 7, based on declining OBV, decreasing MFI, and a negative Force Index indicating selling pressure. The final recommendation of SELL is determined by the alignment of trend, volatility, and volume analyses, which all indicate bearish conditions with high confidence levels. The overall confidence level of 7 reflects the strong consensus among these agents, despite the neutral signals from candlestick and momentum analyses. The trend and volume indicators are given more weight due to their higher confidence scores and stronger alignment with the market's bearish sentiment."

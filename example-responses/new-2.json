    "candlestickAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 3,
      "rationale": "No significant candlestick patterns have been detected in the current 15-minute interval for BTCUSDT, indicating a lack of clear directional bias. The absence of both bullish and bearish patterns suggests market indecision, which is further supported by the lack of neutral patterns like Doji that typically signal potential reversals or continuation. Given this lack of pattern confirmation, a HOLD recommendation is appropriate until more definitive signals emerge. The confidence score is low due to the absence of pattern-based evidence to support a stronger recommendation."

    "momentumAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 6,
      "rationale": "The RSI values are neutral, fluctuating around 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The Stochastic Oscillator shows %K crossing below %D, suggesting potential weakening momentum, but not decisively indicating a sell signal. Williams %R is approaching oversold levels at -100, hinting at a possible reversal. The mixed signals from these indicators suggest maintaining the current position with caution, hence a HOLD recommendation with moderate confidence."
    },
    "trendAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 6,
      "rationale": "The EMA values are showing a slight upward trend, indicating some bullish momentum, but the MACD histogram has turned negative, suggesting weakening momentum. The MACD line is below the signal line, which can be a bearish signal, yet the ADX is above 25, indicating a strong trend is still present. The PDI is higher than the MDI, suggesting the trend is still bullish, but the narrowing gap and recent ADX decline imply potential weakening. Overall, the indicators present mixed signals, warranting a HOLD recommendation until clearer trends emerge."

    "volatilityAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 6,
      "rationale": "The current BTCUSDT price is within the Bollinger Bands, indicating no immediate overbought or oversold conditions. The ATR is moderately high, suggesting increased volatility, but not extreme. The ROC shows mixed momentum with recent negative values, and the CCI is near neutral, indicating a lack of strong directional bias. The PSAR is above the current price, suggesting a bearish trend, but the overall signals are mixed, warranting a HOLD recommendation with moderate confidence."
    },
    "volumeAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 6,
      "rationale": "The OBV shows some volatility but no clear trend, with recent values slightly declining. The MFI is neutral at 67.07, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The ADL remains flat, suggesting a lack of strong accumulation or distribution. VWAP is steadily increasing, indicating a fair value increase, while the FI shows decreasing buying pressure. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a HOLD recommendation with moderate confidence."
    },
    "recommendation": "HOLD",
    "confidence": 5,
    "rationale": "The final trading recommendation is HOLD with an overall confidence level of 5. The candlestick analysis recommends HOLD with a confidence of 3, citing a lack of significant patterns and market indecision. Momentum analysis also suggests HOLD with a confidence of 6, noting neutral RSI values and mixed signals from the Stochastic Oscillator and Williams %R. Trend analysis aligns with a HOLD recommendation at a confidence of 6, highlighting a slight upward EMA trend but conflicting signals from the MACD and ADX. Volatility analysis supports HOLD with a confidence of 6, as the price remains within Bollinger Bands and mixed signals are observed from ATR and PSAR. Volume analysis concurs with HOLD at a confidence of 6, due to neutral MFI and flat ADL. The overall recommendation is determined by the consistent HOLD signals across all analyses, despite varying confidence levels. The confidence level of 5 reflects the moderate confidence scores and the absence of strong directional bias in the market, as indicated by the mixed signals across different analyses. Conflicting signals were resolved by prioritizing the consistent HOLD recommendation across all domains, with no single analysis providing a decisive argument for a BUY or SELL action."

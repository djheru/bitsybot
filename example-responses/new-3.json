      "recommendation": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 3,
      "rationale": "Currently, no significant candlestick patterns have been detected, indicating a lack of strong directional signals in the market. The absence of both bullish and bearish patterns suggests that the market may be in a period of indecision or consolidation. Without clear reversal or continuation patterns, it is prudent to adopt a HOLD strategy until more definitive patterns emerge. The confidence score is low due to the lack of pattern confirmation, reflecting uncertainty in the market's short-term direction."

    "momentumAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 6,
      "rationale": "The RSI is neutral at 44.14, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The Stochastic Oscillator shows %K at 47.30 and %D at 39.55, suggesting a potential upward momentum but not a strong buy signal. Williams %R at -52.70 is also neutral, not indicating extreme conditions. The mixed signals from these indicators suggest a HOLD position with moderate confidence, as there is no clear trend direction currently."
    },
    "trendAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "SELL",
      "confidence": 8,
      "rationale": "The EMA values are showing a slight downward trend, indicating potential bearish momentum. The MACD line has crossed below the signal line, with the histogram showing increasing negative values, suggesting a strengthening bearish momentum. The ADX is above 25, indicating a strong trend, with the negative directional index (MDI) significantly higher than the positive directional index (PDI), reinforcing the bearish sentiment. These indicators collectively suggest a strong sell signal, hence the recommendation to SELL with a high confidence level of 8."
    },
    "volatilityAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "SELL",
      "confidence": 7,
      "rationale": "The current market data suggests a SELL recommendation. The price is near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential oversold conditions, but the CCI is significantly negative at -73.13, suggesting continued downward momentum. The ROC is negative at -0.96, indicating bearish momentum, and the PSAR is above the current price, reinforcing a downtrend. Although the ATR is relatively high at 280.35, suggesting volatility, the overall indicators point to a bearish sentiment. Therefore, a SELL recommendation is appropriate with a confidence level of 7."
    },
    "volumeAnalysis": {
      "recommendation": "HOLD",
      "confidence": 6,
      "rationale": "The OBV shows a slight upward trend from recent lows, indicating some accumulation, but not strong enough for a buy signal. The MFI is in a neutral range, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The ADL is flat, indicating a lack of strong accumulation or distribution. VWAP is stable, showing the price is trading around a fair value. The Force Index has turned negative, suggesting selling pressure, but not significantly enough to warrant a sell recommendation. Overall, the indicators suggest a hold position with moderate confidence."
    },
    "recommendation": "SELL",
    "confidence": 7,
    "rationale": "The final trading recommendation is a SELL with an overall confidence level of 7. This decision synthesizes insights from multiple technical analysis domains. The candlestick analysis suggests a HOLD with a low confidence of 3 due to the absence of significant patterns, indicating market indecision. Momentum analysis also recommends a HOLD with a moderate confidence of 6, citing neutral RSI and mixed signals from other momentum indicators. However, the trend analysis strongly recommends a SELL with a high confidence of 8, highlighting a downward trend in EMA values, a bearish MACD crossover, and a strong ADX indicating a bearish trend. Volatility analysis supports a SELL recommendation with a confidence of 7, noting the price near the lower Bollinger Band, negative CCI, and bearish PSAR, despite high ATR indicating volatility. Volume analysis suggests a HOLD with a moderate confidence of 6, pointing to slight accumulation but not enough for a buy signal. The dominant SELL signals from trend and volatility analyses, both with high confidence levels, outweigh the HOLD recommendations from candlestick, momentum, and volume analyses. The strong bearish indicators in trend and volatility analyses, coupled with the lack of bullish signals, lead to a SELL recommendation. The overall confidence level of 7 reflects the strong bearish sentiment from key indicators, tempered by some neutral signals in other analyses."
